ASViewController
=================

Ever wanted to have subviewcontrollers managment when supporting pre ios 5 system versions. 
Now with ASViewController you can build your can do it. Even you don't need subviewControllers 
to be subclasses of ASViewController, it can be standard UIViewController.

Working on iOS 4.0 and above.

When running on iOS 5, system methods are used.
